The tenth Passive and Active Measurement conference will be held April
1-3rd, 2009 in Seoul, Korea. PAM focuses on research and practical
applications of network measurement and analysis techniques. The
conference's goal is to provide a forum for current work in its early
stages. Original papers are invited from the research and operations
communities on topics including, but not limited to:

<!--
<p>PAM values contributions that are broader than experimental papers.
Data and tool release are seen as first-class contributions and
preference will be given in that direction.</p>
-->

<p>
The PAM steering committee believes that releasing measurement data
allows for better science to be conducted in the field of network
measurement. Therefore, an award will be given at PAM 2009 for the
best paper based on a new dataset that the authors are releasing for
community use in subsequent research. To qualify, a paper must
significantly utilize a dataset that has been collected for the work
presented in the paper. Further, the dataset must be freely available
to any researcher; wireless data sets may, for instance, be published
through <a href="http://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu">CRAWDAD</a>. Authors should flag papers they wish to be considered
for this award with a footnote on the first page of the paper. Novel
datasets are especially encouraged. The awarded paper will be chosen
from the set of qualifying papers accepted for the conference by a
committee made up of a subset of the program and steering committees.

will be given once a paper has been accepted.

<br>Authors are, as always, asked to refrain from submitting papers
submitted to PAM to other venues during the reviewing period.
The editor names should be "Renata Teixeira and Steve Uhlig".
</p>

<p><b> Submission</b>

Use <a href="http://www-rp.lip6.fr/crp-pam2009/">the paper submission site</a> to register a paper, submit a paper for review
and submit your final zip file. 
<br>
Note, at least one author for each accepted paper is expected to register and
attend the conference.
